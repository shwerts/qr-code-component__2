## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Using responsive units like `rem` to collaborate with user and user agent's font settings

For example, setting font size for heading and text:
```
.heading {
  font-size: 1.37rem;
  ...
}
.text {
  ...
  font-size: calc(1rem - 1px);
}
```
